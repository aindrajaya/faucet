<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Counter dApps (Decentralized Applications)
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project is my own exploration and the result of my [Project-based learning](https://www.pblworks.org/what-is-pbl) to explore more deep on how Ethereum Faucet works and also knowing well about the logic that happening on that application. This project I also inspired from [Jackson Ng](https://github.com/jacksonng77) and also from [Filip Jerga](https://github.com/Jerga99) Udemy course. Thank you!!

Here's why I built this and my purpose for this Repository:
* This project can help me on how to figuring out the flow of Fauce application works 
* And this project can help me on my development stage to build another application based on Ethereum blockchain and also it can make me easier to add eth more freely for my own purpose

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
